# Primitivas

This project shows a graphical calculator for the primitive roots of unity of order n, where n is a variable parameter.

The roots of unity of order n are the solutions to the equation 1 = xn.

This equation always has 1 solution of 1 and n-1 extra solutions, which have modulus 1 and are generally not real. Therefore, a two-dimensional plane with a circle of radius 1 can be used to visualize these results. That is precisely what this project does: there is a textbox where one enters the value of n, and based on that, it automatically calculates and displays where the n roots of unity are for that value.

I developed this project to have a visualization tool for the complex mathematical concept of "roots of unity," which I encountered during my studies in algebra. As a visual learner, I found it challenging to grasp the concept intuitively, and I wanted to create a solution that would help me and others like me understand it better.

This proyect was made using JavaScript and P5.JS, and can be teste in the following git hub page:
